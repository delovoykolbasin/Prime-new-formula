## Overview

This repository contains code implementing a novel quantum resonance model for prime numbers based on the 3DCOM universal orbital framework. Originally derived for planetary spacing, the model applies nonlinear exponential scaling combined with resonance filtering to predict prime distributions.

## Core Concepts

- A universal scaling constant:

  \[
  LZ = 1.23498228799485631
  \]

- A resonance amplitude constant:

  \[
  HQS = 0.2355012867
  \]

- Quantum resonance states approximate prime positions, defined by:

  \[
  n_k = \frac{k + 0.5}{0.3}
  \]

  for integer \(k\), producing discrete “quantum orbits” selecting primes.

- The prime growth sequence approximately follows:

  \[
  p_n \sim a_0 \times LZ^{(n – n_{\text{referential prime number}})}
  \]

- The cube \(LZ^3\) appears as a natural scaling factor estimating growth over about three quantum steps, useful for size prediction.

## Features

- Quantum state analysis of resonance \(n\)-values.
- Resonance amplitude conservation verification.
- Prime growth ratio computation and correlation with \(LZ\).
- Predictive pattern identification for prime resonances.
- Growth limit estimates based on computational feasibility.

## Usage

Run the provided script to:

- Analyze resonance quantum states.
- Calculate prime growth ratios.
- Predict next prime size estimates.
- Understand the nonlinear scaling and resonance structure underlying prime distributions.

## Notes

- This model does not replace classical primality tests but provides a novel heuristic and theoretical framework.
- The connection between planetary spacing and prime resonance is detailed in separate repositories (links can be added here).
- Computational limits arise quickly due to exponential prime size growth.
